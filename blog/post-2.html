        <p>A step-by-step breakdown of building a simple lead automation system using a static website.</p>

        <p>

If you're manually copying leads, sending repetitive emails, or updating spreadsheets every day — you're wasting scalable time.

This is the exact process I used to build my first automation system that:

Captures leads automatically

Stores them in Google Sheets

Sends instant email responses

Notifies me in real time

Triggers follow-ups

No backend. No complex infrastructure. Just smart systems.

If you're into web development, AI automation, or building digital services, this will help you think differently.

The Problem: Manual Lead Handling

My workflow looked like this:

Someone fills out my website contact form

I manually copy their info

I paste it into a spreadsheet

I send a follow-up email

I set a reminder to check back

It worked — but it didn’t scale.

The biggest issue wasn’t time.

It was inconsistency.

Missed follow-ups = lost revenue.

The Goal: Build a Simple Lead Automation System

I wanted a system that would:

Capture and store every lead automatically

Send an instant confirmation email

Notify me immediately

Trigger structured follow-ups

In short: a lightweight CRM without paying for one.

The Stack I Used

Simple, lean stack:

Static website (HTML/CSS)

Contact form

Form handler (no backend needed)

Google Sheets

Automation platform (Zapier-style workflow)

Everything runs in the cloud.
